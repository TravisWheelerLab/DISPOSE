# DISPOSE

## Introduction

DISPOSE (Detecting Instances of Software Plagiarism from Online-Sourced Plagiarism) is an open-sourced software implementation of plagiarism detection algorithms originally proposed by [MOSS](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/publications/papers/sigmod03.pdf) and [WASTK](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sp/2017/7809047/). Furthermore, DISPOSE extends these ideas by providing a framework for separate groupings of different source material such as those retrieved using [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) or past submissions from previous course offerings. DISPOSE provides easy accessibility to using the process through a web portal that can be accessed [online](https://dispose.cs.umt.edu/) or ran on a local server using this repository.
